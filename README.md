# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project acts as both a study guide and a reference for me to use as I go through this web dev bootcamp. It is able to randomly tell me what course to study while also being full of examples that show me exactly how to write CSS, JavaScript, Git, or HTML. While building this study guide I learned how code is both complicated and very basic, how it stands alone but also relies on what comes before it, and I learned that code can be stored separately or housed together in the same folder but still be just as intertwined in both cases.
